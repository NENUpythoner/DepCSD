# DepCSD
This repository is a detailed description of the article "Depth-Conditioned Self-Supervised Dehazing for Real Scenes"

Fig.1 The model framework of DepCSD. First, the hazy image is input into the initial dehazing method and depth map prediction method to obtain the preliminary transmission map, atmospheric light, depth map, and predicted image. Gaussian noise and Meshgrid noise are generated by custom noise generators CreatGaussion and CreatMeshgrid. The depth map is used as the condition for guiding noise to fit the transmission map, atmospheric light, and clear image, and is input into the MDI-Net and DIP \cite{ref85} tailored for DepCSD, respectively. The predicted clear image is constrained and updated through ASM.

## Images
